		<p>
			I'm Chuyi Yang. I had my undergraduate studies at Nankai University in China and earned Master's degree from Yale University.
			I am now working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Azure Networking team.

			I enjoy reading, writing and watching TV series. My ideal way of life is to read books or write whatever I want, listening to my favorite songs. Westlife will always be my favortite. Right now I'm listening to Fleetwood Mac to bring myself back to the old rock ages.
			I love running. I like getting myself exhausted and then totally refreshed after running a long distance, which makes me a 'walker' when travelling. Travelling is a big part of my past and will be an even major part of my future.

			Lucky to have you read my blog.
