			I'm Chuyi Yang. I had my undergraduate studies at Nankai University in China and am expecting my Master's degree from Yale University.
			Soon I'll be going to Microsoft Azure to work as a Software Engineer.

			Though a CS girl, I expand my interests to a lot of fields that are irrelevant to my major. My ideal way of life is to read books or write whatever I want, listening to my favorite songs.
			Travelling is a big part of my past and will be an even major part of my future.

			Lucky to have you read my blog.
