		I'm Chuyi Yang. I did my undergraduate studies in Nankai University, Tianjin, China. I am expecting my Master's degree from Yale University.
		I will soon be going to Microsoft Azure to work as a Software Engineer.

		Though a CS girl, I expand my interests to a lot non-relevant fields. My ideal way of life is to read books or write whatever I want, listening to my favorite songs.
		Travelling is a big part of my past and will be an even major part of my future.

		Lucky to have you read my blog.
